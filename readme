1) Install Library for DHT
You will not find this library in your Rasp Pi's Raspbian repositories, so first you have to download it,

wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.50.tar.gz
uncompress it,

tar xvf bcm2835-1.50.tar.gz
and cd into the directory it creates, so you can build and install the library:

./configure
make
sudo make install
Now you can cd back out (cd ..) and install the Node.js DHT module:

npm install node-dht-sensor

Add PM2 to autolaunch the Node app
